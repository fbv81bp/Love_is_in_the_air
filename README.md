# 'stenem! Terhes vagyok... Vajon kinek?

Well that is a word game in Hungarian, based on a story that once upon a time newspaper students had to craft articles containing religion, sex and mystery. The winner submitted "God! I'm pregnant... Wonder who did it?"

Now in the Hungarian language the word "terhes" for pregnant also means "burden" and the modified version in this manner translates to "God! I'm a burden... Wonder to whom?" But the trick is that only the question, "kinek" = "to whom" is that differentiates between the meanings of being "terhes". If it were "kit≈ël" = "from whom", it would refer to pregnancy.

Now you all get it.
